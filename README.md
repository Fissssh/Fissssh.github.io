# Fiss Project

Fiss is a new social media app, dedicated to people who love fishing activities from around the world.
The app is still in development, and we are working too hard and try fix the problems it contains.
Fiss name itself is inspired from my brothers who like to find spot fishing, and anglers interconnected with each other. For sharing places, sharing impressions, and sharing fish. Fiss is an abbreviation of Fishing Sharing Spot. 

Would you help us to development it, please contact us.
